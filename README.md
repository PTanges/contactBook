# contactBook
with pickling

'''
You will implement the edit_contact function. In the function, do the following:
Ask the user to enter the name of the contact they want to edit.
If the contact exists, in a loop, give them the following choices 
Remove one of the phone numbers from that Contact.
Add a phone number to that Contact.
Change that Contact's email address.
Change that Contact's name (if they do this, you will have to remove the key/value pair from the dictionary and re-add it, since the key is the contactâ€™s name. Use the dictionary's pop method for this!)
Stop editing the Contact
Once the user is finished making changes to the Contact, the function should return.
